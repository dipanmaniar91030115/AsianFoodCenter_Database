The term \"Impressionism\" is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris. Monet\'s ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works.

It states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a, b and c, often called the \"Pythagorean equation\": {a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2},} a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}, where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b the lengths of the triangle\'s other two sides. Although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him, the theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras as it is he who, by tradition, is credited with its first proof, although no evidence of it exists.There is some evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula, although little of it indicates an application within a mathematical framework.Mesopotamian, Indian',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(5,2,1,'Euclid','4th century BC','3rd century BC',NULL,'Euclidean geometry',NULL,'Euclid, sometimes given the name Euclid of Alexandria to distinguish him from Euclides of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the \"founder of geometry\" or the \"father of geometry\".

His Elements is one of the most influential works in the history of mathematics, serving as the main textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) from the time of its publication until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the Elements, Euclid deduced the theorems of what is now called Euclidean geometry from a small set of axioms.

Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \"less-than\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. In efficient implementations it is not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved. Quicksort can operate in-place on an array, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
